# YouTube and Web Content Summarizer using Langchain and Groq

## 📝 Project Overview

This project is a **web-based application** that allows users to **summarize content** from YouTube videos and web pages. It leverages **Langchain's LLM (Large Language Models)** with the **Groq Gemma-7b-It model** to generate concise summaries. The application is built using **Streamlit** for the frontend and supports both YouTube and web URLs for content extraction.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Summarize Content**: Generate a 300-word summary of the content from YouTube videos or websites.
- **URL Input**: Input a YouTube or web URL and retrieve a text summary in seconds.
- **Secure API Integration**: Uses Groq API for accessing powerful language models.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Clean and interactive user interface built with Streamlit.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Langchain**: For handling chains of LLMs and prompt management.
- **Groq Gemma-7b-It model**: For language model processing.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web interface.
- **Python**: The main language for the backend.
- **YouTubeLoader & UnstructuredURLLoader**: For extracting content from YouTube and websites.
